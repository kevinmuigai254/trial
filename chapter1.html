<p class="a1">CHAPTER ONE</p>
<P class="a2">
 it was the opening school day when mamaba was to join highschool.The day began dramatically as there was a blackout in the area and mamba 
 needed a headshave.As the rules of the new school he was to join were clear that every student was to report for admission with their heads
 shinning as smooth a newly born's baby buttock.Since no barber shop was operating due to the blackout they had to compromise the situation
 his father gave him a quick shave with his scissors.

<p class="a3">   
      Mamba:[i can't believe i am losing my afro due to school rules.whoever invented school rules should just burn in hell.]
        (mamba said to himself)
</p>
<p class="a4">
After he was shaved they proceded to school where there was a very big security check,to ensure that nobody was admitted with illegal items.
well when i say illegal i mean snacks and home clothes.The inventors of this rule thought that if everyone came to school with home clothes 
some students would end up dressing more expensive than some teachers salary.There was a no snacks policy and evryone was to eat school 
provided food.The search did not go so well for mamba as he was caught  trying to sneak a phone.He was spared since the teacher on duty 
her mother were church mates but under a stern warning.He joined the rest of his schoolmates for orientation which took one week.A program in 
which they were taken through what the school expected of them.They were later released to go to class and start learning after a week going 
the school to be familiar with the environment and the teachers.Mamba who was still experiencing homesickness had a rought time.He was not used
to the evening preps ,which was a session dedicated for students to be in class with no single teacher doing personal studies.He used to sleep
during the evening preps and eventually his day of reckoning reached.All he remembers is being woken up with a hot slap.

<p class="a5">
      Teacher:[Young man did you travel all the from upcountry to come and sleep in school]
</p>
<p class="a6">
      Mamba:[no,i was actually praying for the school]
</p>
<p class="a7">
On that day mamba got a historic beating.Preps were so tough for mamba to cope with, on another good day in the middle of the preps session he 
decided to go to the toilet.To his bad luck he was caught by the teacher on duty.The teacher on duty mercilessly gave him a punishment of going
back to class while squatting.He pleaded with the teacher that he was about to pee and if he squats he would definetilly pee on himself but the 
teacher still insisted on him to do the punishment.He was actually wearing his favourite uniform and he ended up peeing on it.He had to wash 
the uniform for three consecutive days for it to go back to its original form.That marked the begining of his beef with the teachers.His worst
teacher of all time was the maths teacher who took all the lessons.On one P.E. lesson just after mamba had changed his clothes to sports attire
and was ready to go to the pitch and play,Mr edwards their maths teacher walked in.The whole class tried to explain to him that it was not a 
mathematics lesson but a P.E. lesson but Mr Edwards insisted that they would learn mathematics.Mind you the next lesson was to be a double 
mathematics lesson but he insisted that since he was free they would have a tripple back to back mathematics lesson.Well it was he was not only
taking P.E. lessons.One day the biology teacher became sick and mamba thought that they were going to have a free lesson.To his surprise mr 
Edwards walked in.
</p>
<p class="a8">
      Mr Edwards:[i am just from the staffroom and i have received information that your biology teacher is hospitalized so we are going to 
      have a mathematics lesson]
</p>
<p class="a9">
    Mamba:[to hell with maths] (mamba said to himself)
