<p class="a1">CHAPTER ONE</p>
<P class="a2">
 it was the opening school day when mamaba was to join highschool.The day began dramatically as there was a blackout in the area and mamba 
 needed a headshave.As the rules of the new school he was to join were clear that every student was to report for admission with their heads
 shinning as smooth a newly born's baby buttock.Since no barber shop was operating due to the blackout they had to compromise the situation
 his father gave him a quick shave with his scissors.

      Mamba:[i can't believe i am losing my afro due to school rules.whoever invented school rules should just burn in hell.]
        (mamba said to himself)
</p>
<p class="a4">
After he was shaved they proceded to school where there was a very big security check,to ensure that nobody was admitted with illegal items.
well when i say illegal i mean snacks and home clothes.The inventors of this rule thought that if everyone came to school with home clothes 
some students would end up dressing more expensive than some teachers salary.There was a no snacks policy and evryone was to eat school 
provided food.The search did not go so well for mamba as he was caught  trying to sneak a phone.
