<p class="a">CHAPTER ONE</p>
<p class="a1">
It was the opening school day when mamba was to join highschool.The day began dramatically as mamba needed to get a head shave as per the school rules of the new school he was to join,to his bad luck there was a power blackout in the whole area.So all barber shops were not functioning.The rules of the new school were crystal clear that every student should join the school with their heads shining like the buttock of a newly born baby.They had to improvise ,his father had to give him a quick shave with scissors.
